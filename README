This is a fork of the existing WATIR Recording tool Scott Hanselman created years ago

The DotNet implementation is housed here so if anyone wants to work on the source code you can.

The main focus will be the WatirRecorder.rb file that is under the folder.

Current plans for WatirRecorder.rb file:
1. wxruby UI
2. Optimize code
3. Refactor code for Firefox, IE, and eventually Chrome

Looking for help, so if you have time I would greatly appreciate it.
