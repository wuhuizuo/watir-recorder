#summary Status for November Release

= Introduction =

Scott Hanselman (http://www.hanselman.com/) gave this project his blessings in his email:

Email #1: Awesome.  Have fun with it and keep me updated. I'm glad you like it.
Email #2: Just do add my name to the project or something to let folks know where it came from.

Scott, this intro is for you...

Anyway, here are the needs for the first alpha release...

= Details =

* Remove *Sand Dock* from the code since it isn't compatible (I assume...)
* Unit Test what exists
* Add a way to capture file input actions
